# DuplicantPicker

This program will continuously shuffle all three duplicants until they all have "Diver's Lungs" and one of either "Pacifist" or "Gastrophobia".

Others may be added in the future.

I may modify this program to also analyze the actual stat combination of the duplicant and automatically reshuffle if the stats are too low.

If you get a Duplicant that you don't like, simply hit shuffle once then re-run the program.
